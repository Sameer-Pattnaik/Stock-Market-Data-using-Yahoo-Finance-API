# Documentation for `get_stock_data`

## Overview
The `get_stock_data` function retrieves historical stock market data for a specified ticker symbol within a given date range and saves the data in JSON format. It utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch the data and implements a retry mechanism for HTTP requests.

## Dependencies
- `yfinance`: Library for accessing stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- `requests`: Library for making HTTP requests.
- `urllib3`: Provides utilities for retrying HTTP requests.
- `json`: Standard library for handling JSON data.

## Function Definition

### `get_stock_data(ticker, start_date, end_date, json_file)`

#### Parameters
- `ticker` (str): The stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "GOOGL").
- `start_date` (str): The start date for the historical data in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
- `end_date` (str): The end date for the historical data in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
- `json_file` (str): The file path where the JSON data will be saved.

#### Returns
- None: The function saves the stock data to the specified JSON file.

#### Exceptions
- The function may raise exceptions related to network issues or invalid input data.

## Usage
To use the `get_stock_data` function, simply call it with the desired parameters. Below is an example of how to use the function:

```python
ticker_symbol = "INFY"  
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2023-09-01"
json_file_path = "stock_data_with_dates.json"  # Path to store the JSON data

# Get stock data and save it to JSON file
get_stock_data(ticker_symbol, start_date, end_date, json_file_path)
```

## Function Workflow
1. **Setup Retry Mechanism**: A session is created with a retry adapter that attempts to reconnect up to three times in case of failure, with an exponential backoff strategy.
2. **Fetch Stock Data**: The `yfinance` library is used to fetch the historical market data for the specified ticker within the provided date range.
3. **Data Processing**:
   - The index of the DataFrame is reset to include the date as a column.
   - The DataFrame is converted to JSON format with the date formatted as ISO strings.
4. **Save JSON Data**: The JSON data is saved to the specified file path with pretty formatting.

## Output
The function will print a message indicating that the stock data has been saved, e.g.:
```
Stock data saved to stock_data_with_dates.json
```

## Conclusion
The `get_stock_data` function provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve and store historical stock market data in JSON format. By leveraging the capabilities of `yfinance` and implementing a robust retry mechanism for network requests, this function ensures reliable data retrieval even in the face of transient errors. The resulting JSON file can be easily used for further analysis, visualization, or integration into other applications, making it a valuable tool for anyone interested in stock market data.
